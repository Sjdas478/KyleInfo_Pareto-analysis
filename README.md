# 🛍️ KyleInfo Customer Complaint Analysis
## 📊 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze customer complaints for a large e-commerce company using Pareto analysis. The objective is to identify the key product categories and complaint reasons that contribute to the majority of customer issues, allowing the company to focus on the most impactful areas for improvement.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Perform Pareto analysis on complaint volumes by product category

* Identify top complaint categories and reasons using the 80/20 rule

* Visualize complaint trends using dual-axis Pareto charts

* Provide actionable recommendations for reducing customer issues

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
* Google Colab (Python)

* pandas for data manipulation

* matplotlib.pyplot for visualization

## 📌 Tasks Performed
   Task	Description
✅ Task 1	Load data and preview top 5 rows
✅ Task 2–3	Count complaints by product and sort them
✅ Task 4–5	Calculate cumulative sum and percentage
✅ Task 6	Plot Pareto chart for product complaints
✅ Task 7	Filter top 4 complaint-heavy products
✅ Task 8–9	Analyze and rank complaint reasons for those top 4
✅ Task 10	Create a second Pareto chart for complaint reasons  

## 📈 Key Insights
  Top 4 products account for 80% of total complaints, validating the Pareto principle.

  Within these products, the main complaint reasons include:

 ❗️ Missing item
 
 📦 Poor quality
 
 🚚 Damage on delivery

These complaint drivers are repeatable and fixable through better operations, packaging, and logistics.

## ✅ Recommendations
📦 Improve packaging and handling processes for high-complaint products.

🚚 Optimize delivery for faster fulfillment and fewer late deliveries.

🔁 Set up auto-escalation for repeat complaints in top product categories.

🧠 Use findings to train support teams on recurring issues.
